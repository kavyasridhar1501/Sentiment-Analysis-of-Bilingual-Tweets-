# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Bilingual-Tweets

We aim to implement a Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of identifying the sentiments of bilingual tweets (Tamil and English).
Classify the tweets present in the dataset into positive and negative. Implement the model for different classifiers and evaluate their performance based on accuracy and F1 scores.
